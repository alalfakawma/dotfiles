Contrary to what other people use eg. GNU Stow, yadm, etc, I wrote a script to
copy config files of different programs and store it in `~/.dotfiles`, this is
where git is initialized. And I have a cron job that goes off everyday at 9PM
to push it to Github so I always have the most up to date backup of my dotfiles.
